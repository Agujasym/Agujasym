- 👋  Hi, I’m @Agujasym
- 👀  I’m still figuring out what I'm interested in in the software world.
       But outside of that I work in Chemical Engineering, with a focus on the nuclear sector.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Python, Java and C#. I've started working with Azure Cloud infrastructure and SQL recently too. 
      Generally I'm having to do more software-related stuff than I originally bargained for at work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Java project (probably).
- 📫 How to reach me: for now just message me on here.
